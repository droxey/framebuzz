Add moment-by-moment social commenting to your embedded videos.


== Description ==

Add moment-by-moment commentary to the videos you post, and let your viewers 
interact with you and each other around every second of a video. With the 
FrameBuzz plugin, you can:
*   Post comments, questions and analysis at specific times in a video; those 
comments play out for later viewers at the moment in the video they were 
made
*   Weave your own unique perspective, commentary and sense of humor into the 
videos you share
*   Let your viewers interact while they watch, instead of posting a comment at 
the bottom of a page after the fact

The plugin lets you FrameBuzz any YouTube video in seconds, and post it as 
easily as embedding a video. 
 

== Installation ==

1.  Install FrameBuzz either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by 
uploading the files to your server.
2.  Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress.
3.  If you would like to link FrameBuzz to your YouTube account to make it 
easier to find your own videos to FrameBuzz, enter your YouTube channel ID 
in the FrameBuzz Settings menu.
4.  That's it! The FrameBuzz button will now be available on any new post.
