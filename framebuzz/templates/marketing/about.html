            <h1>MANIFESTO</h1>
            <p>FrameBuzz is a free, online video conversation platform that enables moment-by-moment discussions within a video. As the facilitator of interesting conversations between content creators, experts, and consumers, FrameBuzz brings more to a conversation than just words – it brings meaningful connections and unique perspectives that help shape the way a video is perceived, shared, and discovered.</p>

                    <p>We’re social. We’re engaged. We’re right there with you. We’re FrameBuzz. Born out of co-founders Aaron Lindsey and Jason Kohn’s never-ending excitement for great content and passionate debate, we’re helping you curate that online conversation, frame by frame. </p>

                    <h3>What We Believe</h3>
                    <p>At FrameBuzz we believe that video viewers are more than just people – they’re influencers. They have valuable opinions that deserve to be shared, and through their individual comments, praise, questions, and curated conversations, those viewers have the ability to transform a video from content to something so much more.</p>

                <li>
                    <h3>Why We’re Different</h3>
                    <p>For us, it’s more than just leaving a comment that’s never to be seen again. It’s about crafting meaningful dialogue in the most intuitive way that has a chance to change a video’s perspective and shape its direction.  We’re helping to create a community of passionate words, dynamic videos and conversations that matter.</p>
