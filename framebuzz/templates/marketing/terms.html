                <h1>Other</h1>
            </div>
            <p>Governing Law. You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in Texas; and (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over FrameBuzz, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than Texas. These Terms shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of Texas, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state or federal courts located in Travis County, Texas for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below.</p>
            <p>Arbitration. In the unlikely event that FrameBuzz has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any FrameBuzz claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by binding arbitration, except as provided herein. The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing FrameBuzz from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to protect any of FrameBuzz’ proprietary interests. ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND FRAMEBUZZ ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>
            <p>General. FrameBuzz and you are independent entities, and nothing in the Terms, or via use of the Services, will create any partnership, joint venture, agency, franchise, sales representative, or employment relationship between FrameBuzz and you. These Terms supersede any previous Terms of Service and represent the entire agreement between FrameBuzz and you. If any provision of the Terms is adjudged to be illegal or unenforceable, the continuation in full force of the remainder of the Terms will not be prejudiced, and the illegal or unenforceable provision of the Terms shall be severed accordingly. No waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and FrameBuzz’ failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
            <p>These Terms were first published and made effective on April 27, 2013.</p>
