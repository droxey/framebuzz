                        <p>AUSTIN (KXAN) - FrameBuzz is trying to get people buzzing in Austin when it comes to conversations about videos.</p> <p>The <a href="http://framebuzz.com/" target="_blank">video-conversation platform</a> launched on Tuesday, letting its viewers comment within a video online – moment-by-moment– for free. FrameBuzz provides on-demand social conversation around every second of video.</p> <ul> <li> <strong> <a href="http://media2.kxan.com//PDF/FrameBuzz.pdf" target="_blank">How does it work?</a> </strong> </li> </ul> <p>So you can interact with viewers, and even the video creator, through threaded conversations tied to specific video moments.</p> <p>“Social conversations around online video are disjointed right now and filled with spam, giving people a bad taste in their mouth when it comes to video commenting,” said co-founder Jason Kohn. “Instead of using separate social networks to have conversations around videos or using static, after-the-fact commenting, people can use one platform for coherent, threaded, moderated conversations within the video itself.”</p> <p>Creators said they want those conversations to live on as part of that video, in the moment, anytime someone presses play.</p> <p>You and the friends in the conversation don’t have to watch the video at the same time, either.</p> <p>FrameBuzz lets you log in and comment whenever’s most convenient for you. Company creators say the agenda is to make conversation around video.</p> <p>"Whether you have a home video or like a YouTube video, grab that link, drop it into Framebuzz and begin the conversation,” said FrameBuzz CEO Aaron Lindsey. "We want to change the way people interact with video."</p> <p>He added that what they’re seeing in Austin is that the community’s starting to grow around video, including technology.</p> <p>Still, FrameBuzz is more so focused on the social experience of it all, making it easy to work on your tablet, too.</p> <p>"FrameBuzz provides the glue between content creators and video connoisseurs whose interactions will shape the way video is produced, shared and discovered," Lindsey. "We look forward to sharing FrameBuzz with more creatives -- both here in Austin and nationwide -- to help curate meaningful conversations with their audiences."</p> <p> <strong>Get started</strong> </p> <ol> <li> <a href="http://framebuzz.com/" target="_blank">Sign up</a> for a profile.</li> <li>In seconds, start commenting on top FrameBuzzed videos from around the Web.</li> <li>Users can then FrameBuzz their favorite YouTube and Vimeo videos to embed on a site or their FrameBuzz profile page.</li> <li>Invite friends to join in on the conversation.</li> </ol> <p> <strong>In-Depth: FrameBuzz’s other functions</strong> </p> <p>Website that host video content can easily FrameBuzz their YouTube or Vimeo videos to get realtime feedback from viewers, answer questions and give additional information in the context of the video.</p> <p>Austin Fashion Week investor and consultant James Leasure privately tested FrameBuzz before it’s official launch and saw it as a way to drive conversations and feedback about details people care about.</p> <p>“I love the idea that people can comment on FrameBuzzed videos of Austin Fashion Week, ask questions of designers, and then the designer can come back in and tell them if that design comes in a different color or where they can buy it,” said Leasure. “Creating a direct dialogue between parties with our video content as the mediator is a huge win for everyone involved.”</p> <p> <strong>More about Frame Buzz</strong> </p> <p>FrameBuzz is a free onlne video conversation <a href="http://media2.kxan.com//PDF/FrameBuzz.pdf" target="_blank">platform that enables moment-by-moment conversations</a> within a video.</p> <p>The social technology eliminates static, after-the-fact commenting beneath online videos and curates conversations tied to specific video frames for deper, contextual conversations.</p> <p>Content creators can quickly and easily FrameBuzz their YouTube and Vimeo videos and embed on their website, empowering their audience to start conversations with one another, frame by frame.</p> <p>Users also have the freedom to watch FrameBuzzed videos on their own time without the fear of missing out on real-time discussions.</p> <p>The startup began in 2013 and calls Austin home.</p> <p>You can find the company on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Framebuzz" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and on <a href="https://twitter.com/framebuzz" target="_blank">Twitter.</a> </p>
